# Key DAX Formulas
Total Sales
Formula: Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
Explanation: This formula calculates the total sales amount by summing up the values in the Sales Amount column of the Sales table.
Total Profit
Formula: Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
Explanation: This formula sums up the profit values from the Profit column in the Sales table to get the total profit.
Sales by Region
Formula: Sales by Region = CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALLEXCEPT(Sales, Sales[Region]))
Explanation: This formula calculates the total sales for each region by removing all filters except the Region column.
Top Products by Sales
Formula: Top Products = TOPN(10, SUMMARIZE(Sales, Products[Product Name], "Total Sales", [Total Sales]), [Total Sales], DESC)
Explanation: This formula returns the top 10 products based on total sales. It uses the SUMMARIZE function to group by product name and calculate total sales, then TOPN to get the top 10.
Year-to-Date Sales
Formula: YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
Explanation: This formula calculates the year-to-date sales by summing the total sales from the beginning of the year to the current date.
